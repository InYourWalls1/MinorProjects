Very small python program which converts yt links to audios (Windows specific)

Requirements:
1. requires having python installed (you can get it at https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. requires having yt dlp installed (right now the program should be able to install yt dlp on its own, thought if it fails you'll have to download it normally)
